### Wallet Software

The Daedalus Wallet that comes with the Cordana blockchain can be downloaded here <https://daedaluswallet.io/>

It first needs to sync with the blockchain, which seems equivalent with downloading it.

We need to test if it works offline firstâ€¦

### Offline Address Generation

1. Once Daedalus is finished synchronizing, it shows options to create a new Wallet.
2. Unplug the PC from the internet and disable Wifi and Bluethooth options.
2.  click *Create*
2. Think of Wallet name (no Password needed)
3. Click *Create personal wallet*, check the checkbox
4. Click *Continue*
5. Register the Recovery Phrase
6. Reconfirm it
7. Check both checkboxes and click *Confirm*
8. Go to *Receive*
9. Register the *Address* together with the Recovery Phrase
10. Repeat this until enough keypairs are generated
11. Now, complete wipe out the harddisk, reformat it and reinstall the operating system.

### Using the Address Online

1. Start and sync a wallet
2. Click on *Restore Address*
3. Enter the Recovery Phrase
4. Start sending
