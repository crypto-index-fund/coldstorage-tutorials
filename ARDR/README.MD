# Ardor

### Wallet Software

Ardor is a coin that (for now) lives on the NXT blockchain. It can be handled using the NXT Desktop. The installer can be downloaded here <https://nxtplatform.org/download/>. During installation, indicate that we want to use the Light Client.

### Offline Address generation

1. Start the wallet on an offline PC
2. Click on *New Account*
3. Register the automatically generated 'password' (which is the mnemonic) as well ass the public account address. These are the private key and the public key.
4. Repeat it as often as you need addresses (shutdown the application and restart)



### Using the Address online

1. Start the wallet on an online PC
2. Click on *New Account*
3. Ignore the automatically generated mnemonic and click *Want to use your own password, click here*
4. Paste and re-paste the mnemonic that you registered before
5. Click *Register*
6. Now we should find out how to send the ARDR. Either the possesion of it will be automatically recognized, or we need to add the specific ARDR id, which is 12422608354438203866
