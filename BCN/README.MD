### Wallet Software

There is a Bytecoin Paper Wallet that can be downloaded here: <https://bytecoin.ninja/paperwallet.html>

It can be run offline. 

For the online wallet, we use the official Desktop Wallet that can be downloaded here: https://bytecoin.org/downloads

### Offline Address Generation

1. Start the Paperwallet by loading `paperwallet.html` using a browser.
2. Click on *… or generate*
3. Move the mouse to generate Entropy
4. From the generated addres, register the Address, the Tracking key, the Passphrase and the Private Key.



### Using the Address Online

1. Start the Desktop Wallet.

2. Connect it to a remote daemon (in preferences/settings), as to prevent the complete blockchain synchronisation. Use `node.bytecoin.ninja:8081` 

3. Import the private key, through File -> Import Key.

4. Choose a dummy file name.

5. Wait for it to synchronize.

6. Go to *SEND BYTECOINS*
