# Wallet Software

### Wallet Software

The [web wallet](https://tronscan.org/#/wallet/new) can be saved as HTML (from Chrome) and be run offline.

For the online wallet we can use the Chrome Add-on for Tron, to be installed [here](<https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tron-wallet/nlojapkcleceehbbknkkjamcpmaliabo>).

### Offline Address Generation

2. Click on *Open Wallet* -> *Create Wallet* in the right upper corner.
3. Think of a difficult password, e.g. `nEvCXA5KfAPpXqwjBqa`
4. Click *Next* twice
5. Click on *PRINT PAPER WALLET*
5. Register the Address and the Private Key
6. Refresh the page and repeat the process to generate another one.

### Using the address online
