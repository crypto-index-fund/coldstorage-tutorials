# Wallet Software

### Wallet Software

For the offline address generation, we use the [desktop wallet](https://github.com/TronWatch/Desktop-Wallet/releases) version (TronWatch).

For the online wallet we can use the Chrome Add-on for Tron, to be installed [here](<https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tron-wallet/nlojapkcleceehbbknkkjamcpmaliabo>).

### Offline Address Generation

1. Start the TronWatch app
2. Click on *Create New Wallet*
3. Click on *Receive* and register the Public Key.
4. Go back and click *Backup Wallet* in the right upper corner.
5. Register the Private Key and maybe the picture of the Mnemonic
6. Create a new Wallet for a new keypair.

### Offline Transaction Signing

Using one address it is possible to Offline Sign a transaction and submit it on <https://tronscan.org/#/tools/transaction-viewer>. 
(Should still be tested).

### Using the address online

1. Open the Tron Wallet Chrome Addon .
2. Login with the Primary Key of the Active Address.
