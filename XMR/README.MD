### Wallet Software

There is an online Monero wallet available at <https://mymonero.com/#/>. You can log in there using a mnemonic or a combination of a public key, view key and spend key.

A better, but more complicated option is using `monero-wallet-cli`.

For offline address generation we use this HTML file: <https://github.com/moneromooo-monero/monero-wallet-generator/>

### Offline Address generation

1. Start the offline wallet generator
2. Click *Generate Wallet*.
3. Register the Public Address, the mnemonic, the spend key and view key.

### Using the Address online
