### Wallet Software

There is an online Monero wallet available at <https://mymonero.com/#/>. You can log in there using a mnemonic or a combination of a public key, view key and spend key.

An online Desktop Wallet can be found here <https://getmonero.org/downloads/#windows>

For offline address generation we use this HTML file: <https://github.com/moneromooo-monero/monero-wallet-generator/>

### Offline Address generation

1. Start the offline wallet generator
2. Click *Generate Wallet*.

### Using the Address online
