### Wallet Software

The online wallet is the Nano Vault, downloaded from here [https://github.com/cronoh/nanovault/releases]

For the offline address generation we can use this paper wallet: <https://github.com/vitorcremonez/nano-paper-wallet>. It can be installed using `NPM`. 
Alternatively, downloading it from [here](https://vitorcremonez.github.io/nano-paper-wallet/), as a complete website, and running it by loading the `Nano Paper Wallet.html` works as well, though it is a bit ugly.

### Offline Address generation

 1. Load the file `Nano Paper Wallet.html`
 2. Click `Generate New Wallet Now`
 3. Register the SEED, the Private Key and the Public Key

### Using the Address online
 
 1. Start the Nano Vault
 1. Click 'IMPORT EXISTING WALLET`
 1. Enter the SEED
 1. Enter a dummy password (twice)
 1. Click 'Set Password'
 1. Go to View Accounts
